## ðŸ”¹ Pods
- The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes
- Multi-container pods (sidecar, adapter, ambassador patterns)
- Pod lifecycle and restart policies
  
A Pod is the basic execution unit of a Kubernetes applicationâ€”the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you can create or deploy. A Pod represents one or more processes running on your cluster. Cluster is a set of worker nodes that run containerized applications. A Pod encapsulates an application's container(s), associated storage resources, a unique network identity (IP address), and configuration options that govern how the containers should run. A Pod represents a unit of deployment, a single instance of an application in Kubernetesâ€”which may consist of either a single container or a small number of containers that are tightly coupled and share resources.
